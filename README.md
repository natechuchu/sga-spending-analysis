## ðŸ§  Overview
Liberty's Student Government Association Treasury Department is in charge of funding for over 100 clubs across campus. Every fiscal year, data regarding purchases and allocations is collected and stored in sepearte excel sheets. However, prior to this project, the treasury deparment had never compiled all the data into one single report, as there weren't unified standards across different administrations as to how the data should be collected and stored. Because of this, the department reached out to me and tasked me with cleaning all the data from the past 5 years and extracting insights for future budget allocations.
