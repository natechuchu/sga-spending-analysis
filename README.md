## 🧠 Overview
The Liberty Student Government Association's Treasury Department is responsible for funding 100+ student organizations. Despite having data spanning five fiscal years, no unified report had ever been compiled due to inconsistent record-keeping across changing administrations.

I was brought on to:
- Clean and standardize historical data
- Uncover trends in spending
- Build an interactive dashboard for future planning

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Standardized club names by merging variations (e.g., “AAA,” “Asian American Assoc,” “Asian American Association”) under single IDs
- Cleaned inconsistent date, time, and currency formats
- Fixed broken Excel equations and improved accuracy
  
## 📈 Data Visualization
- Visualized data with Power BI in 18 different charts/diagrams
- Crafted DAX equations to uncover further insights

## 🎊 Outcomes
- Discovered patterns in club spending, allowing the Treasury to allocate more money during weeks of higher cash flow
- Uncovered which years the highest percentage of clubs received fulfilled budget requests, solidifying which budget allocation processes were most effective
- Determined underutilized club budgets, improving future budget allocation decisions
- Gained real-world experience working with messy data sets 
- Learned how to visualize data and extract valuable insights.
